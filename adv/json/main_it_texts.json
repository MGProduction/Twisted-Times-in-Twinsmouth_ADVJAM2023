"Uh... that thing was NOT here before"
,"Did you find the four authors?"
,"Yes, but two of them said they won't come"
,"Of course"
,"Not all of them"
,"Please go get them all"
,"Howard, I really hope that this attempt _ with several writers at once _ works _ because so far, dealing with more than one at the same time _ is like a nail in the eyes"
,"I surely need a drink"
,"Do you know you look like E.A. Poe?"
,"ThatÂ´s because I'm Edgar Allan Poe"
,"Ha ha ha ha _ E.A. Poe is long dead!"
,"They keep telling me that _ I don't think I like it"
,"Where's the secret thing for ideas?"
,"In your head?"
,"I mean the food, or the drink!"
,"Oh, yes, there's something to drink in the lounge"
,"Yes! I knew that!"
,"There's also the plant juice _ if there is any left"
,"Not sure today it can help _ but we're not sure of a lot of things"
,"Thanks"
,"Please go get the writers"
,"There's a mansion nearby _ is it normal that above its stone wall there is a scary giant octopus-like animal? _ it seems to have killed a man by the way _ and not one with a red-shirt"
,"How big? _ Like a horse?"
,"More like four horses with a carriage"
,"Go and check"
,"Sure"
,"You, come with me"
,"What if you call the owner _ and send him for an errand? _ He could close us in and we could check his notebook while he's away"
,"We could try"
,"Rick? _ It's me, Fish'n'Chips guy _ my voice? _ don't worry about my voice _ Bring me fish, now!"
,"How does it go?"
,"Let's go down and check"
,"If we had the hotel phone number _ we could call the owner and fake a business request _ to make him go away so we can check his notebook"
,"Marco's number seems offline"
,"There are a lot of books _ most of them are notebooks written by doctors, nurses or patients _ but there are also some historical books and medical ones"
,"There's a section about patients _ they're sorted by first name"
,"It's not the smarter sorting decision but for us it's the same _ without a hint they're too much anyway"
,"We cannot read or take them all _ without knowing what we need it's useless to pick one or another"
,"Let me check the historical ones"
,"There's a Guido Pinkhouse biography"
,"What does it say?"
,"Who's Guido Pinkhouse?"
,"The twin brother of Luigi Pinkhouse _ my host in the other city"
,"They founded two settlements on either side of this little river in the early 1800s _ they were good and got rich _ but Luigi lost his wife and son in a shipwreck and went 'mad'"
,"He spent a lot of his fortune trying to find his relatives _ with Guido telling him to stop, because as they were surely dead, this search was pointless"
,"Then Twinsmouth East was destroyed by an earthquake _ while the West Past remained intact"
,"No survivors _ not even bodies _ found in the East part _ not a single hurt person in the West part"
,"What did Guido Pinkhouse do?"
,"Guido mourned his brother and vowed to continue his research"
,"And six months after his brother's death _ he found the body of Luigi's wife."
,"Their ships never reached their destination _ they took another route to hunt pirates _ but then they were hit by a storm _ only three survivors reached Bermuda _ including the wife _ but each of them was too injured to be saved"
,"Guido found that because one of the fishermen who helped these men sold their possessions _ an object in Boston was recognized by someone, and then tracked down _ it was hard but in the end Guido was able to do what Luigi didn't"
,"Who's the biography author?"
,"Uh, this is an unexpected twist _ she's Luigi's great-grandniece!"
,"You never mention Luigi's son wife"
,"There was no wife _ he had a lover, a mariner daughter _ and he kept her a secret from his parents _ her father was one of the three people that reached Bermuda _ his diary was recovered and returned to her by Guido himself _ who then treat her like one of the family"
,"What's her name?"
,"Mary Pinkhouse _ Guido wanted his nephew's lover take his second name _ she was expecting a son, called John, when Luigi's son died _ John had several sons, including a daughter, Lucy _ who's the mother of the biography's author, Sara Curie _ ah, Lucy was a patient in this place"
,"So was Lucy mentally ill?"
,"Yes, for a while, when she was in her fifties _ Her daughters led a very hard life for a long time _ and she was clearly influenced by her mother's obsessions about this place and her family _ she not only wrote an accurate biography of Guido, but she also recovered his mortal remains _ and in a special case, his hand _ that's now buried under the outer statue"
,"A HAND?"
,"It's not so clear why _ but she wrote that both the hand and her mother's handwritten diary are crucial to the existence of Pinkhouse Cove"
,"Before today I would have said that she was crazy _ not so sure now"
,"Ok"
,"Let's search for Lucy's diary!"
,"Found!"
,"Welcome _ I sensed the bridge closing _ so you must be the last host _ but... mmm.. _ I don't remember your face _ who are you?"
,"Dan Brownx?"
,"Not even close"
,"An uninvited guest?"
,"That's hardly possible"
,"An unexpected guest?"
,"Mmm... ok"
,"Nevermind _ the more the merrier if things are already bad as I thought"
,"Eh?"
,"Anyway feel free to walk around if it's your first time here _ but don't go too far _ it's not safe now _ and within half an hour reach us in the hotel lounge _ won't you do me a favor? _ there are four writers wandering nearby _ would you ask them to come to the hotel lounge?"
,"Four writers?"
,"Thanks _ see you soon"
,"Uh... my cellphone is vibrating _ even if it's still dead"
,"Hello? _ Hello?"
,"MARCO! WE NEED YOUR LAPTOP PASSWORD!"
,"Stefania? Can you hear me?"
,"Ok _ that was REALLY odd _ but it means she read my message on the statue I guess"
,"Mmm... 'WE need your laptop password'? _ who's WE?"
,"Hello?"
,"MARCO? THE SYMBOL ORDER YOU ASKED IS 7 1 5 6 3 4 2"
,"Stefania?"
,"Ok _ nice to know"
,"Are you REALLY Dan Brownx?"
,"Yes?"
,"Can you explain to me what's happening?"
,"I can tell you what I know _ there's a place on the other side of the river _ where the east part of this town is still intact _ maybe it's a moment in the past, I don't know _ and in that place, imaginations and dreams seem more vivid and real _ I've met two dead authors there _ and a man that lives in a mansion uphill _ a man devastated by sorrow and madness _ but that can feel and eat and feed a writer's mind"
,"It's a bit hard to believe"
,"My memories about that are dream-like _ but I'm sure of what I said _ and when I've started to think about it _ once returned _ I'm sure that his power is dangerous _ not only for his guests _ but for everyone _ if he'll be able to expand himself outside that place"
,"What can we do now?"
,"No clue _ but it's impossible that there's a passage like that _ near a small town like Pinkhouse Cove _ and nobody knew anything about that _ so my best bet is: let's see if there's someone or something that can help us"
,"How the mansion in the East town was?"
,"It looks similar, but better kept _ I spent most of my time in the dining room _ I was supposed to meet my mysterious host, but they said he wasn't feeling well _ when I was there, I heard screams coming from the first floor _ it was a great night anyway _ I've never felt more in touch with my creative side than I did that one time"
,"What about this ugly plant?"
,"You said that Marco somehow told you that it was possible _ to be heard from this place with something old enough with you?"
,"Yes, that was clearly his first message."
,"But why would it work?"
,"No idea _ but you have one instead, right?"
,"This plant, this root or branch, I don't know, is connected to the power _ that controls the other side _ and the passage too"
,"So it's LOOKING or HEARING at our side?"
,"It's trying to expand itself _ but the point is _ it's a connection to the other side _ you're talking here, near it, and something could be heading there."
,"What about the old article?"
,"It might 'smell' strange _ this thing seems 'sleepy' _ maybe certain things activate it more"
,"OK"
,"But there's more _ if I'm right, it might be possible to send something through it to the other side _ something small _ and specific _ if we can enlarge the passage"
,"How?"
,"Not sure yet"
,"You're welcome"
,"He's DAN BROWNX!"
,"Hello!"
,"Hello to you!"
,"He's G.R.R. Martyn"
,"Hi!"
,"Hello"
,"She's J.K. Rowlyng"
,"He's R.L. Styne"
,"Yep"
,"He's Stephen Kyng"
,"He definitely reminds me of Poe from a film"
,"He seems a dandy"
,"He definitely reminds me of Lovecraft on a book cover"
,"He looks like an action film hero, but from the fifties"
,"Good Morning! How can I help you?"
,"Good morning! Please stand by _ my instrument is very sensitive"
,"Rbtttz!"
,"Bnuhtz!"
,"Brahn'tm"
,"Hey puppet? _ Sleep!"
,"Yes! It works! Now he stopped to follow me"
,"Hey puppet? _ Live!"
,"Yes! Follow me!"
,"It has a panel _ let's put these leaves inside him"
,"Done _ now it smells like curry leaves"
,"The puppet seems wooden _ don't think it needs oil to move"
,"I don't want to hurt it _ above all if then I'm going to make it move"
,"It has a panel _ let's put the novel inside it"
,"Not sure if it was needed _ but it was a good idea"
,"It's a potentially dangerous thing _ I don't think it's wise to try to poke things or people with that without a reason"
,"It's Dan Brownx's invitation _ the paper is quite odd _ greenish and smelling"
,"I've paid a lot to have it _ but it's a very nice story _ I should write it down sooner or later"
,"Let's see if there's a way to embed the feather in this wand _ Done!"
,"It looks great _ but I prefer eating it later"
,"It's completely dead"
,"Done _ uh, I've also emptied the chilli bottle _ that means that it was already opened and used"
,"I don't think it can be improved any more than that"
,"I don't think curry would be the right choice for this sandwich"
,"Ok, let's grease this saw with curry oil"
,"Done"

,"Prologue"
,"Baltimore"
,"28th September 1849"
,"Mr. Poe?"
,"I am here to bring you an invitation from my Master, one of your greatest admirers."
,"Leave me alone"
,"A written invitation and a small gift"
,"I'm not interested"
,"He expected such a reaction _ That's why he gave me this note for you"
,"'the initial version of 'The Haunted Palace' you decided to rewrite was better' _ 'It's a shame you burnt it'"
,"Uh!"
,"How can he possibly know that?"
,"If you come, you can ask him yourself _ but listen _ your time is limited _  so you need to decide quickly _ it's a long travel to reach the Master"
,"Does your Master have a name?"
,"Mmm _ yes _ at least one of them does"
,"Providence"
,"13th August 1931"
,"Howard? _ Someone brought an envelope for you_ I put it on your table"
,"Oh, thanks, Aunt Lillian"
,"Um... _ 'Dear Mr Lovecratf, _ I kindly request your presence at my master's mansion on the 15th of August' _ 'He's enthralled not only with all your published works, _ but also with your future ones' _ 'And he's sure you'll enjoy your stay with him."
,"Who's the sender?"
,"A crazy person, I would say."
,"What?"
,"Nothing, Aunt _ a 'fellow' writer, I guess"
,"What did he send you?"
,"Let's see"
,"there's a train ticket with the letter"
,"uh, an impressive antique statuette!"
,"and... a drawing... but... that's impossible!"
,"A better version of one of my sketches _ one I've never shared with anyone!"
,"Pinkhouse Cove"
,"NOW"
,"Marco, are you sure this is the right place? _ It doesn't look like the resort you showed me!"
,"Yes, honey"
,"And when I asked where the sauna was, they laughed at me!"
,"Sure, honey"
,"Are you listening to me?"
,"Of course I am! Why do you ALWAYS ask me that?"
,"But _ have you ever thought about it? _ How is it that I can't find a single shred of a plot for an adventure game _ and there are authors who write books every year _ each one more beautiful than the last?"
,"Well, I don't want to sound offensive but..."
,"Exactly! There must surely be a TRICK!"
,"...I actually think that..."
,"And they laugh when you ask them _ 'where do you get all these ideas from'!"
,"Because the question is..."
,"They're afraid we'll find out their secret! It's obvious that there must be a PLACE _ where they get the good ideas!"
,"What do you mean? a place to find inspiration?"
,"Inspiration? _ Where are we, in a fairy tale? _ I mean a place where you go and GET ideas!"
,"Um... maybe they EAT them"
,"Or maybe they DRINK them?"
,"Have YOU started drinking?"
,"Wait..."
,"There she is! _ DO NOT TURN AROUND"
,"But... was she that wizard kid author?"
,"Shh... You don't know what it cost me to track her down."
,"What are you..."
,"Hey, was he STEPHEN KYNG?"
,"Never mind that _ you were talking about costs!"
,"A huge amount indeed _ but nothing compared to the price of robbing Dan Brownx's house!"
,"What do you mean ROB?"
,"Sure, honey _ let's follow them!"
,"Wait!"
,"Can you please tell me what is going on?!"
,"Sure _ once I find the secret place"
,"In that case I'm not following those people into the forest!"
,"By the way this sign says the road ahead is blocked AND dangerous"
,"Good idea _ stay here _ and whatsapp me if they come back"
,"But..."
,"See you later"
,"Uh... something is moving in my bag! _ It's not the mobile _ mmm... whatever"
,"I knew it! _ Despite the sign, there's a bridge!"
,"Marco?"
,"Are you there?"
,"Damn it!"
,"Wait for me! I'm coming!"
,"Epilogue"
,"Woah... just in time!"
,"And now what?"
,"What, what? _ we're back _ and this damn thing is probably back where it belongs _ in the ocean"
,"Let's hope _ deep enough"
,"Yes _ and now we simply have to go back to work _ and forget all this _ but the good parts"
,"Good parts? _ Which good parts?"
,"The blood parts! _ But even more the ones in which we've seen and enjoyed our creations"
,"I missed those parts! _ And I wasn't able to eat any great ideas!"
,"EAT ideas?"
,"And I have a jam soon! _ And not a single clue for my game!"
,"I think we're done _ better leave now before discovering _ that this guy is mad and dangerous _ and we helped him"
,"Agreed"
,"Me too"
,"Well..."
,"I don't know what your 'jam' is _ but if you need a story _ well _ they're everywhere _ anything you see or do can help you with that _ even the more common and normal ones"
,"You mean _ I could write a game about this thing that we lived together? _ It's a COOL story _ and I could include all you famous writers! _ at worst just changing ONE letter of your names"
,"Well, I didn't say that..."
,"That's SO cool _  I can make a game that features myself and Stefania as characters!"
,"It's not what I meant with..."
,"It will be the BEST GAME EVER!"
,"Ehm... _ I'm going now _ DON'T FOLLOW ME _ but above all _ DON'T INCLUDE ME in anything of yours!"
,"DON'T"
,"YES!"
,"Marco's House"
,"14 days later"
,"Marco? _ Dan just wrote me an email _ with the final details he was looking for"
,"Dan?"
,"Yeah, Dan Brownx _ we keep in touch, you know _ he's a great man"
,"He checked the dates and found that _ E.A. Poe was brought back to Baltimore _ but in very bad shape _ he died a few days later"
,"The other authors seem to have included _ some of what happened in their later production _ the Nautilus idea for once _ but so did Salgari"
,"H.P. Lovecraft took a lot from it _ and when he returned, he also wrote 'The Shadow over Innsmouth' _ published later, but probably written in the next few months"
,"About Twinsmouth / Innsmouth, there's more _ Do you know who's also written about a place _ where sea creatures and humans met? _ Luigi's great-grandchild! He made a cartoon about it two years ago _ Pinkhouse is the English version of Luigi and Guido's surname _ Casarosa"
,"Sure, honey..."
,"but _ well, sorry, I'm checking the results of AdvJam2023 right now _ so I'm a bit distracted"
,"Oh! Great! And how did your game go?"
,"Uh"
,"Did you win?"
,"Nope"
,"Well, at least you surely finished in the top ten, right?"
,"A little less than that"
,"Oh... like what?"
,"My game is the 1800th game"
,"..."
,"out of 1800 participants"
,"Uh... the hotel is closed! _ There's a sign _ 'I need to run an errand, I'll be back real soon _ sorry for the inconvenience'"
,"This is the first time this has happened to me _ to find a hotel closed for errands"
,"Did you notice something odd lately?"
,"Who's been sick? _ Not my fault, I swear!"
,"Nothing. How can I help you?"
,"Are you the Fish'n'Chips supplier?"
,"Nope _ why do you ask? _ who's been sick?"
,"I'm going to look at what you're selling"
,"You look like a smart girl _ I mean, you wear glasses _ so may I suggest you look at our book selection? _ we haven't sold that many books _ and they collect dust"
,"Well, this question is the strangest thing that has happened in a while, I guess"
,"You are the bookworm in the family, he says"
,"Oh... yes _ I have loved books since I was a child _ well, living in a small place means being bored most of the time _ but reading has helped me more than that _ and I like to share what I like"
,"Just out of curiosity _ can you tell me your latest preferences in terms of author names?"
,"Let me think... _ I love Stephen Kyng and G.R.R. Martyn _ but also Rownling _ and even R.L. Styne _ but my favorite is surely Dan Brownx"
,"His books are boring as hell _ but he's so handsome _ he reminds me of my father"
,"What a coincidence..."
,"Please, shut up"
,"How have books helped you?"
,"I know it sounds stupid _ but when I was in primary school _ in the 60s _ I started to feel really sick _ nightmares too _ a living hell _ but then I started reading and suddenly felt well again"
,"Suddenly?"
,"Ten minutes after starting 'Slaughterhouse 5' _ which my dad put on the same display _ I felt better and I've never been so sick again _ I've read two books a month since then"
,"Do you know you look like Louise Matthes?"
,"Well, yes _ she was my mother _ how do you know her?"
,"We've seen an old school picture in the local museum"
,"The museum? _ You mean the old school _ it closed in the 90s and since then it has changed 'occupation' several times"
,"We lived there, you know? _ my mother was a teacher and we had two rooms on the second floor"
,"Do you also know the mansion nearby? _ Was it opened when you were young?"
,"No, it's been closed since forever _ someone just cleans the garden each month and checks the interior for problems once or twice a year"
,"But... _ I mean _ yes, I know the mansion nearby"
,"How do you know the mansion?"
,"The school building was part of the mansion, in the 19th century _ there was a door to the garden then _ they closed it when it became a school"
,"but I lived there _ it's possible to reach the garden from the bathroom's window _ I was a kid _ I used it all the time _ and go play in the garden when my mom was busy"
,"It was fun _ but scary _ considering that the mansion had been a 'madhouse' for twenty years _ before my mum was born"
,"A madhouse?"
,"For such a small place this town has a long strange history _ in the second half of 1800 a lot of local people had mental problems _ but slowly things got better _ and the madhouse was closed _ but then the mansion remained unused"
,"Any idea about the reason for the mental problems?"
,"Several _ but nothing was certain _ The only fact is before the end of the 1800 things started to be better"
,"You're welcome!"
,"Mmm... there's a small selection of titles from famous contemporary authors..."
,"Hey! there's also a couple of Dan Brownx's novels!"
,"Really?"
,"Oh... I don't really like them _ but my mum over there is a fan _ and she's the one who chooses the books we put on display _ she's always done that"
,"Small selection _ I've already got all the titles I like"
,"The usual range of groceries for a small general store _ from cornflakes to sauce bottles _ a lot of things look old _ I don't recognise most of the brands"
,"Most of those things are not suitable to be eaten while walking"
,"Hey, there's a bottle of chilli!"
,"It's 4 dollars"
,"Some beers and soft drinks _ and a bunch of homemade sandwiches"
,"Mmm... I could use a sandwich to go"
,"please help yourself"
,"Ehm... what happened?"
,"That damn fridge! _ Is the third time today it stopped"
,"It's all right _ after some hours it usually starts again"
,"It's 5 dollars"
,"Thanks _ ah, if you want _ we sell also some gastroprotective drug"
,"Nice to know"
,"I think I'll pass"
,"Well, as the sign said, the bridge is missing _ and the other side's collapsed _ So where's everybody gone?"
,"Wait _ it may seem a stupid question but _ are you DAN BROWNX?"
,"Maybe"
,"What are you ALL doing here?"
,"All, who?"
,"Another even more stupid question _ have you been robbed recently?"
,"How do you know that?"
,"Long story"
,"And, sorry to be unpolite, I don't have time for that _ I need to reach the other town _ and see if they let me enter _ without my invitation"
,"No bridge _ As I expected _ the passage is closed"
,"What passage?"
,"Now I've got time for your long story _ how do you know about my invitation robbery _ and why are you here?"
,"I have questions too _ what passage? _ and where is MY HUSBAND?"
,"This story is probably even longer, but _ wait _ is your husband a very famous writer?"
,"And he was walking along this path _ and now he's nowhere?"
,"Exactly"
,"Well _ then he may be in mortal danger _ we ALL may be in grave danger too _ depending on how wise he is"
,"Are you saying that we're DOOMED?"
,"Let's stick together _ we have to find a way to open the passage _ and rescue him _ and then close it for good"
,"Marco? Can you hear me?"
,"We don't know if this works or how _ let's keep it short _ let's just say what we need to communicate _ if he hears us he probably can answer at least using the museum"
,"Marco? We need your laptop password!"
,"Well it sounds like a very stupid request"
,"Marco? The symbol order you asked is 7 1 5 6 3 4 2"
,"Hey!"
,"Scary!"
,"Does it eat it? _ let's hope it took it to wherever and whatever Marco is"
,"It seems to ignore it"
,"It ate it! _ let's hope it took it to wherever or whatever Marco is"
,"It doesn't want this"
,"Did you see that?"
,"He perceived that food"
,"I don't want to give it to the plant _ I'm not sure I don't need it to be heard"
,"After giving it the curry sauce it seems to have an open mouth"
,"Wow _ what's that thing?"
,"I may have an idea about that"
,"I don't want to touch it"
,"No, I can't come right now _ I have guests"
,"Yes _ REALLY _ an odd couple _ a dude that doesn't seem able to count to four _ and a cute lady _ if you're into 'cougars'"
,"HEY!"
,"She's back now _ with another man _ so, no, she's any way out of your league"
,"Ok, ok _ I'll ask her if she wants MORE company"
,"Bye"
,"Good morning, how are you? _ Do you..."
,"Ok, ok _ no need to scream"
,"How's you're always on the phone?"
,"The hotel usually doesn't have many guests _ so I take extra gigs _ let's say I do more or less everything for everyone here _ cleaning _ providing things _ I also sing during weddings _ not that there are many around"
,"Is this really a five-star hotel?"
,"Sure! I mean _ it depends _ does Tripadvisor count? I've had five one-star reviews so far _ so for me, if you ask me, that makes us a five-star hotel"
,"I'm ok, thanks"
,"Can I take one?"
,"Sure!"
,"I already have one"
,"There's a bunch of business cards from this premise _ they seem home-printed"
,"I don't want to use cleaning tools _ while I'm on vacation!"
,"A cheap set of standard cleaning tools"
,"Well, they seem cheap because they're not this hotel properties"
,"They belong to the museum _ I forgot to put them back in their storage room after I used them"
,"But why are they here?"
,"Ehm... I needed to clean rooms too _ considering your arrival _ and we don't have any"
,"Sorry _ this is mine _ and it's private"
,"Let's see _ yes! _ there's the number to open the storage room in the museum"
,"It's a small notebook with papers tucked between the pages"
,"I wonder if there he wrote also the Museum keypad code"
,"It's possible _ we need a way to check that"
,"How good is your memory?"
,"What? What memory?"
,"The door is locked"
,"Don't want to do that now"
,"Let's try the password we found"
,"Yes _ we're in"
,"There are a lot of e-mails about the 'Writers Big Lie' _ ah _ here's the contact with the guy that robbed your house"
,"I have something to say to him"
,"Not now _ we may need his help"
,"Let me ask him if he can check the symbols sequence in my books"
,"Mmm... ok... this guy's not stupid"
,"I got the answer _ Mediterranean symbols from the pre-Hellenic period _ some claim they are related to Atlantis _ anyway they seem to be constellations names _ so I write you the most logical sequence I can think of"
,"Even if we don't know which kind now"
,"Let's check if in your husband's computer there's something _ we could use it to understand what he knew about the place he decided to enter"
,"There's a password _ and I don't know it"
,"How old is your husband?"
,"55-years-old"
,"Manga or videogames or both?"
,"Videogames"
,"Try 'pacman123'"
,"Mmm... it doesn't work"
,"Odd _ but ok _ we need some help here"
,"It's five-year-old Marco's laptop _ he hardly moves without it"
,"Please, stand back"
,"proximity to people could distort data"
,"Uh... ok"
,"Good morning!"
,"Are you here for HIM too?"
,"What? Who?"
,"Mr. B!"
,"WHAT?"
,"Yes _ correct _ always DENY _ enemies are always listening"
,"BUT I'm so near finding PROOF"
,"Then we'll see who's laughing last!"
,"What's that instrument?"
,"My latest invention _ scans the brain frequency of anthropoid apes"
,"Do you mean, human beings?"
,"Eh? _ No, I mean anthropoid apes _ like Mr. B-I-G F-O-O-T"
,"Why are you here, on the sea?"
,"Because in town the instrument receives interference"
,"I mean, why are you here in this SEA TOWN?"
,"Ah... because my students gave me tickets for the local museum"
,"Where do you teach?"
,"Albuquerque"
,"A long trip to see a little museum _ are you a fan of local sea traditions?"
,"No, why? _ my students said it's a B-I-G F-O-O-T museum"
,"Of course it is, fool of me"
,"See you around"
,"Uh... when I talk about my hometown I always get hungry."
,"Oh... it's for me?"
,"a local herring sandwich?"
,"Thanks, but no thanks"
,"I would like something that reminds me of home"
,"With chilli? I love it!"
,"It was DELICIOUS _ but now I don't feel too well _ I mean _ I think I'm going to puke _ I'm not sure _ but I'd rather be in a more private location"
,"Why should I do that?"
,"Oh... it's for me? _ thanks but I don't like curry"
,"Oh... it's for me? _ thanks but I don't like fish'n'chips that much"
,"It's a ticket for the local Museum _ for today"
,"Mmm... I want a ticket _ the Professor probably doesn't need it anymore _ so, well"
,"If I want to go to the museum _ I'll simply buy a ticket"
,"Uh _ a lot of writings about the precence of bigfoots during the centuries"
,"Nope _ don't want to steal the professor research _ To burn it is of course a completely different thing"
,"I surely cannot take it _ or move it"
,"There's a label... 'Guy Pinkhouse, merchant and explorer, founder of Twinsmouth West'"
,"Door firmly locked"
,"The gate is heavily locked _ even from this side is not easy to open it"
,"The window is closed, but it doesn't look too solid _ but I'm too scared of tetanus to touch such an old thing"
,"Can you try to force that low window?"
,"I can try"
,"I don't need his help now"
,"This part of the ground seems a bit different from the rest"
,"I think it's where the statue was before"
,"Uh _ there's something half-hidden in the ground"
,"If this is the place where the statue was _ maybe it's here the case with Guido's hand"
,"Let's see if I can find something even without a shovel"
,"Yes... there's a small sealed box"
,"And, uh, inside there's actually a HAND _ it's just bones now _ but it's a human hand for sure"
,"There's also a note _ 'Howard, I did as you asked. I really hope Guido's hand can help. Sara'"
,"This is a whole new level of weird"
,"Taken!"
,"There's nothing more here"
,"I don't want get my hands dirty without a good reason"
,"It's a very old book"
,"Taken"
,"It's a painting of the mansion garden _ uh... how odd _ the statue seems to be in a different position _ nearer to the gate"
,"Considering the different 'lives' of this building _ it's not impossible they moved during the centuries"
,"It's firmly attached to the wall"
,"It's an old wooden chest _ heavy and partially broken"
,"The lock is broken _ and it's almost empty"
,"There still are some letters"
,"One seems older than the rest _ let's see _ the sender is a guy from Twinsmouth and it's been written in August 1804"
,"This can be our object from the East town!"
,"Hello! Tickets please"
,"Here you are"
,"This is one ticket _ and you're two people _ are you aware of that?"
,"Yes _ can we both enter with a single ticket?"
,"Are you married?"
,"Technically speaking, yes, we both are married"
,"So we're fine _ there's no such rule of course _ but that way I can add TWO to the visitor list _ and I have an half plausible reason to tell my boss _ considering he's a boomer"
,"Like what?"
,"Like... mmm... _ it's a bit hard to explain"
,"The strangest thing I've seen is tourists"
,"Can we buy two tickets?"
,"No, I'm sorry _ to avoid robberies _ I mean, me stealing money _ we currently only sell tickets online"
,"Ok, then..."
,"But now our site is offline _ and anyway we only sell tickets for the following days"
,"Is there any way to enter, today?"
,"Sure, just show me your already-booked-in-advance online-bought tickets!"
,"Is this museum succesful?"
,"Yes! We're waiting for one visitor today _ that makes ten visitors in two months"
,"And is this succesful?"
,"Yes! _ How many people do you think go to a museum?"
,"How about 'Winter is coming'?"
,"Did you notice that? _ It's a mystery _ that writing was found and recorded in books _ since they found the remaining of Twinsmouth East in early 1800 _ I guess G.R.R. Martyn copied that _ even if I cannot imagine how"
,"The door's locked _ I guess one needs to use the keypad to open it"
,"It's a numeric keypad _ it probably opens the storage room"
,"Let's try it"
,"It works! _ Let's sneak in!"
,"I don't know the needed number"
,"It's a picture from 1935 _ kids in school uniform"
,"The teacher looks somehow familiar"
,"I agree _ check if there's a name"
,"Yes _ she's Louise Matthes"
,"No need to touch it"
,"It's a piece of a statue _ found after the devastation of the nearby town"
,"Hey, what's that writing?"
,"'Winter is coming ha ha ha ha'"
,"How odd is that?"
,"There's also another message _ 'Stefy Alive Bridge Hear Take East Item Marco'"
,"Yes! Marco's alive and still normal"
,"Normal?"
,"We need to find an item from Twinsmouth east _ that we can carry with us _ and then go to the missing bridge!"
,"If you say so"
,"It's under the glass _ I cannot reach it"
,"It's a large piece of a statue _ found after the devastation of the nearby town"
,"Hey, look at this _ there's a writing saying 'My password is PACMAN1234, Marco'"
,"I was near"
,"Hey, look at this _ there's a sequence of symbols _ and a writing saying 'Please help, Marco'"
,"I think I've already seen those symbols"
,"Great!"
,"Not so great _ the guys robbing my house also took my symbol books with them _ and they're not easily replaceable sources _ I really hope to track them down and convince them to give me back my stuff"
,"There are some details about the history of this place"
,"Two settlements on either side of the river _ Founded in 1803 by two twin brothers"
,"They were merchants and became very rich in a short time."
,"In 1807 Luigi lost his wife and son _ and after that his business went bad."
,"On the night of 26 May 1809 his town was completely destroyed by an earthquake."
,"There were no survivors _ not even a single body was found."
,"Blah blah blah _ time after that, even the other town loses importance _ after the First World War the name was changed from Twinsmout West to Pinkhouse Cove"
,"26 May 1809? _ Why this date rings a bell? _ any way a lot of info, not sure if relevant or not"
,"Please, don't touch anything"
,"Nope _ trains are late as usual"
,"Can I have some Fish'n'Chips?"
,"Sure! Here it is"
,"and feel free to take also some of our special curry!"
,"This one I'm going to eat it right now!"
,"It's delicious!"
,"Not right now _ we run out of ingredients _ we're waiting for supplies"
,"How long before new supplies?"
,"Don't know _ the supplier is busier than usual in this period"
,"Can you try to call him/her and check? _ we're eager to taste your food"
,"Mmm, ok"
,"Rick? _ When do you think you can bring me my fish? _ I've got customers waiting here"
,"Ok, ok _ fine"
,"He'll bring my stuff soon _ but I won't wait here for that if I was you _ soon can mean anything"
,"Can I have some curry?"
,"Sure, if you buy also Fish'n'Chips"
,"How special is your curry?"
,"Well, curry trees aren't usually local _ but there have been many nearby since the 19th century _ we use their curry leaves for our curry _ and I really recommend you try it because it tastes great"
,"This is our special curry _ not the usual mixture but our preparation _ from the tree that has grown here for centuries"
,"You can have some, but only if you buy food"
,"There are some small plastic containers full of curry sauce _ curry color is a bit different from usual _ but the smell is good"
,"I've already got one"
,"Yes _ maybe I could use a town free map"
,"It's a box full of free maps"
,"It says they serve Fish'n'Chips with a couple of variants for fish size _ not cheap"
,"Not cheap but the best, and only, in town!"
,"Well _ I don't think I can take it"
,"Bhandari's Fish'n'Chips _ town oldest fish'n'chips _ established 1890"
,"The gate is locked _ and the lock seems untouched for ages"
,"There's a similar mansion also in the other town _ I've been there for the night _ even if I couldn't see our host"
,"There's the name of the current exposition: _ 'Twinsmounth East secrets - the history of Pinkhouse Cove ancient twin city'"
,"This seems interesting"
,"Oh... another one... _ this time it's going to be bloody _ wait _ you don't have a red shirt _ are you a writer?"
,"Sure _ sort of _ are you the 'Stephen Kyng for children'?"
,"Argh... _ at best HE's the 'R.L. Styne for adults' _ I've sold MORE books than HIM _ whatever _ I now hope you're not a writer _ have a nice 'your thing here' _ but now let me go back to this place _ before it starts"
,"Hello? _ Are you good, right?"
,"Hello? Are you alive? _ don't tell lies or I'll know it _ ah ah ah ah _ well, that line sounded funnier in my head"
,"Hey puppet? _ Live! _ Abracadabra? _ Nothing?"
,"It doesn't work"
,"'You only fail when you stop trying'"
,"But remember also 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over _ and expecting different results'"
,"So keep on trying _ but better"
,"It's a scary GIANT puppet _ breathing"
,"tickling it doesn't seem to work"
,"Well, given my lack of carpentry experience _ I can't name an object here"
,"Uhm... there's a small pointy thing _ I think I'll take it"
,"I don't want anything else, for now"
,"Uhm... other unknown tools _ and a small wood saw"
,"Ok _ Now maybe there's a reason to carry a saw _ Let's take it"
,"The saw is small, but not so small _ if there's not a reason for it, I'll leave it here"
,"There's a MONSTER over there!"
,"Which kind of monster? _ I've used so many that it could be mine"
,"It's a giant octopus"
,"It could be"
,"I've defeated the monster over there!"
,"Good _ that means that you reached Luigi?"
,"Not now, but I'm near"
,"Good"
,"Any idea?"
,"Have you got any extra info about the situation?"
,"Well, Lovecraft said their plan is ruined because the monster at mansion gate cannot be tricked _ because it perceives humans"
,"Well, reaching it is not a problem then _ we got him, the puppet _ it won't perceive it _ well, if we can make it move of course"
,"Uhm..."
,"Well, I'm sure to have not all the details, so, no, no ideas"
,"Ok, see you"
,"See you"
,"A Poe-lookalike said to reach him in the lounge"
,"Yes, thanks _ few more minutes with this puppet and I'll come _ don't worry"
,"Tell him I'll surely arrive BEFORE George"
,"Do you know what's up with the masked men?"
,"Masked men?"
,"The stinky pale fishermen-dressed masked men"
,"I think you didn't get the situation _ but anyway _ they're not supposed to attack you"
,"You're a guest, with an invitation and a gift from their Master _ they should respect that"
,"And anyway _ they seem to fear the creative people _ maybe in your case they're just curious"
,"They tried to BITE me _ but, out of context, with 'gift' you mean..."
,"To be here _ even for the first time _ you surely have received an envelope with specific instructions and items _ haven't you?"
,"Sure! Yes! Of course! _ I've just got memory issues _ a genetic thing, nothing serious"
,"Don't you already have enough ideas?"
,"Sorry?"
,"I mean, why are you here? _ It's already like you fell into a cauldron!"
,"I really don't understand what you're saying _ anyway, I'm here because of the mysterious invitations _ like you I presume"
,"What's this scary puppet?"
,"I don't know _ I've always been scared by them _ and this is way scarier _ so I'm studying it"
,"Studying it?"
,"Trying to understand what's making it so scary _ of course is based on Collodi's work _ but there's also a hole in his chest, like Baum's character _ so far it's breathing but it doesn't react or move"
,"Let's hope it keeps on doing that"
,"What's that?"
,"A container used to trap the plant"
,"What do I have to do with it?"
,"It's a box full of wood chops _ they don't seem useful"
,"None of the pieces here seem like a wand"
,"I already have a wand"
,"I don't need them"
,"Which kind of monster? _ My previous time I've seen a different version of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named _ with wings and claws"
,"Not mine"
,"Any plan?"
,"To inject life into this puppet, make a wand"
,"It's in Pinocchio's original story"
,"But I use wands too in my books _ and in my universe they're not just a piece of wood _ they've got something inside that makes them more powerful and personal"
,"like unicorn horsehairs or phoenix feathers"
,"I wonder why I even asked"
,"Not without more info"
,"Are pearls the ones you're wearing?"
,"It seems a very specific request"
,"We may have a chance to free this town _ but we must lure the god into a lead container using pearls as a bait"
,"You must be a sci-fi writer _ I didn't understand a single word of your phrase _ BUT if you need my pearl for a worthy reason, take them"
,"Put them directly in this jar, please"
,"thanks"
,"Yes, it seems a wand"
,"Or just a branch _ it's hard to tell"
,"Uh... a nice feather _ it has even some blood on it _ it might be useful"
,"Let's try that"
,"A submarine emerged!"
,"The submarine went down"
,"I can't move this lever"
,"It's a metal lever"
,"It's a submarine"
,"I've already been able to activate the lever"
,"Ok... let's try this sequence"
,"Something happened!"
,"Mmm... these symbols can be pushed _ this seems a sort of keycode panel"
,"Very interesting _ but what's the sequence we need?"
,"No idea"
,"There's a sequence of symbols I've never seen before"
,"It's the boat I used to arrive here"
,"I need to use the boat to move from here"
,"This is the panel whose reflex you saw from the lighthouse, isn't it?"
,"Yes _ I wonder what's that symbol"
,"I cannot reach it"
,"What do you think of this place?"
,"It's a perfect place _ not so easy to notice from anywhere but the lighthouse _ and large enough to hide something in it"
,"Hello, who are you?"
,"WHO are you? _ you're in MY backyard"
,"Why do you all treat me _ as if I'm some sort of socially inept person! _ This starts to get annoying!"
,"So, WHO are you?"
,"I'm the one not so sure that was wise to come here"
,"You should leave then _ as soon as it's possible again"
,"I'll try"
,"I'm Dhan by the way _ one of the oldest Master's servant"
,"So do you know what's going on?"
,"Yes, I know all about my Master's grief _ and what he has decided to do about it"
,"Can you explain?"
,"It's a really long story"
,"I want to know"
,"What happened to your Master?"
,"Years ago my Master agreed to let his wife go with his son on a journey that could be dangerous _ his son wanted to investigate the loss of some ships in the Sargasso Sea _ he was sure it was pirates _ so he went with two heavily armed boats"
,"He never returned _ no one did"
,"After a long period of fruitless search _ someone came here _ and told my master that he and his companions knew what had happened"
,"Not pirates _ but a sea creature was responsible _ an ancient sentient one _ that may have captured, not killed, my master's relatives, they said"
,"I was sure he was an impostor and I said so _ but my master was desperate and gave money and resources to this man and his friends"
,"But they knew things _ with our money they built incredible machines _ they found something deep under the sea and brought it here"
,"I don't think it's good _ this creature _ this plant _ outside the ocean can do... things"
,"What can this plant do?"
,"it senses emotions, fears, fantasies _ it's able to expand them, to make you perceive them better _ and sometimes it brings them to life"
,"Thanks to it, I've been to the FUTURE _ to summon special people who created emotions, dreams in millions of others _ the plant, through my Master, played with them"
,"And it's given my Master dolls resembling his lost relatives _ it's transformed or killed the people in this town _ and it's getting more powerful every day"
,"I don't understand whether it is trying to free itself and go back to the ocean _ or whether it wants to stay here and destroy everything"
,"Can you do something?"
,"I cannot talk to my master anymore after my last prayers for him to get rid of this thing"
,"He put a man to keep me here, outside of the town _ don't know if to protect me, or to protect somehow the plant"
,"Why did you say so? Is the plant afraid of you?"
,"Not afraid _ annoyed _ and in my opinion it's because of this curry plant _ this creature seems not like it very much"
,"Do you know something about the boat nearby?"
,"It's one of their incredible boats _ that don't need wind or oars"
,"Do you know how to ignite it?"
,"Yes, I went with them several times _ even when they finally captured the plant"
,"I still have the key here _ do you want it?"
,"Yes!"
,"What did you use to lure the plant?"
,"We used pearls _ we had special containers _ that were filled with pearls and the men put them in several places _ after days one was missing _ they prepared another one and when they saw the creature eating they cut a piece of it and sealed the container"
,"Do you recognize it?"
,"Sure. It's one of the containers we used to trap that thing"
,"How were you able to do that?"
,"We used pearls as bait _ containers like that were filled with pearls and the men put them in several places _ after days one was missing _ so they prepared another one and when they saw the creature eating they cut a piece of it and sealed the container"
,"Do you mind if I take some of them?"
,"Suit yourself"
,"Let's take some"
,"I've already taken some leaves"
,"Why should I take these leaves?"
,"These seem leaves _ they smell good"
,"These are leaves from from the curry trees"
,"Do you mind if I take it?"
,"Well... whatever... suit yourself"
,"Hey! Stop!"
,"It's a bottle of oil"
,"It's curry oil I made myself _ here is needed more than you can think"
,"I'll take it then"
,"It's a crystal-like thing"
,"It's a device needed to start an engine-driven boat"
,"Zharf! Zhrfhjfff!"
,"Ok ok _ I won't go that way"
,"Zharf?"
,"Are we cool now?"
,"Zharf!"
,"I'll take it for a yes"
,"I have the impression it wants to bite me"
,"Hey, let's calm down _ I already gave the invitation to your colleague over there"
,"Zharf!!!"
,"Yes? Are you a Start Trek actor? _ Even just an extra?"
,"Are you a founder of a Star Trek club?"
,"Not that I recall"
,"Well, we are a very inclusive group _ so we still love you"
,"But less"
,"Understandable"
,"The convention will start soon, feel free to enter"
,"Is it an alien?"
,"It doesn't seem so _ even if I'm not exactly an expert"
,"Not so interested then _ and we got problems with fishmen"
,"Mmm... are you a writer?"
,"A writer? No!"
,"So why are you here?"
,"For the local convention!"
,"Is there a Star Trek convention HERE?"
,"It's a strange story _ I wake up knowing it _ I traveled without knowing where to go for a while _ then I found this place"
,"And was there a Star Trek convention?"
,"Nope _ nothing was ready yet _ but then other fans arrived _ and we occupied this place _ and look around for memorabilia _ and we found some!"
,"Does this place seem odd to you too?"
,"Not more than any Star Trek convention"
,"Who are those face-masked men?"
,"No idea, probably they are from an unaired season _ they must be angry for that"
,"But they seem to HATE us _ so we're staying here _ closed inside"
,"Ok, bye"
,"Long live and prosper!"
,"What's happened to this guy?"
,"Same as my previous time _ I'm, well, a mass murderer, as a writer _ and what controls this place showed me his appreciation doing the same _ blood everywhere!"
,"I don't remember, was it a dragon?"
,"No, more like a giant octopus"
,"Not interested then"
,"Is it a dragon?"
,"Apart from enjoying the show?"
,"Yes"
,"Any idea about what's going on in this place?"
,"Considering what is happening, if I have to choose between 'it's a God' or 'it's an undersea plant' I guess I'll bet on 'it's a God'"
,"Did you write on the statue over there?"
,"Uh? Ah, yes, last time _ I was curious to see if we're really in the past _ so I made a writing on that statue _ then when I left I've checked and my writing in now visible in the present _ so yes, we're in a different period but of the same timeline"
,"You do something here _ it might change the future"
,"Mmm..."
,"I don't want to touch him _ he's dead _ and bloody"
,"I think it's better if I directly go where I need _ I don't know if this magic will last long"
,"Hello? Are you one of those crazy fishman?"
,"No"
,"Prove it!"
,"If you let me in you can check my face"
,"Mmm... ok _ this sounds logical"
,"It's me"
,"Is that really a mask?"
,"Zu'rath?"
,"It doesn't seem like a mask when you look at it attentively"
,"Is that a knife under your jacket?"
,"Zu'rath!"
,"Are you going to EAT me?"
,"Pun'th'uuuh!"
,"Thanks for the useful conversation"
,"I may have a bit of trouble with your accent _ can you repeat that, slower?"
,"Ok _ It's not the accent"
,"Mmm... _ what does he want?"
,"Uh... I don't want to go near this thing _ it smells bad _ and it seems alive"
,"I don't want to go near this thing"
,"Zuarafn'm! Zu'rath?"
,"Are we ok now?"
,"Hey! You just ate my invitation!"
,"Fine fine _ whatever"
,"Why are you wearing that mask?"
,"Wait, is it a kind of allergic reaction?"
,"Like an allergic reaction to food for ideas?"
,"Is the right direction for the idea place?"
,"Is there an idea food or an idea drink?"
,"Is there an idea FOUNTAIN?"
,"Well, whatever kind of plant this is, two things are sure _ it smells like rotten fish _ and it grows faster than troubles"
,"Mmm... no, I don't want to touch it"
,"A pile of cut branches"
,"Mmm... one of these branches looks like a wand _ there's one that's straight and already short _ let's take it"
,"I already have what I needed"
,"Why should I take them?"
,"It's a little old book _ there's written 'Lucy's Diary' on the front page"
,"Uh... it's a skeleton hand!"
,"Stop there! _ you can't proceed any further _ my Master's orders"
,"Let's try to see if there's a way to hear them"
,"Mmm... I should write something like that _ 'Stefy, I'm alive _ I could hear you if you go to the bridge and speak _ with a thing from the east town in your hand, Marco'"
,"Way too long"
,"I've written 'Stefy Alive Bridge Hear Take East Item Marco'"
,"I'm sure it's clear enough"
,"Ok, let's do that _ let's write my laptop password"
,"on a statue in a public place _ visible for two hundred years"
,"I'm sure any IT guy would vouch for that"
,"Let's also write down the symbols sequence found in the cave _ in the hope that Google will be able to help Stefania with her search"
,"I'm done sculpting for now"
,"Why should I ruin this statue?"
,"It's a statue of a man with a chart and a spyglass in his hands"
,"Mmm... on the base there's a rough incision that says 'Winter is coming ha ha ha ha'"
,"Considering Martyn's experiment _ maybe I could write something on this statue too"
,"hoping that Stefania will see it _ it's a long shot, but I don't have a better chance"
,"But to do that I'd need to use some tool able to leave a mark on the stone"
,"I cannot move it"
,"Go away"
,"Are you a writer?"
,"Are you a monkey?"
,"I mean, sorry _ I'm Marco _ who are you?"
,"I'm Emilio Salgari _ nice to meet you"
,"Did you by chance write something?"
,"Not much _ only several DOZEN of books _ what about you?"
,"So you are Emilio Salgari"
,"Yes, that's me _ from Italy"
,"And how did you arrive here?"
,"An invitation _ a carriage came to pick me up _ I probably slept for a while _ then I found myself here"
,"Your English is good"
,"Well, I cannot explain that at all"
,"Ah, yes... I'm still here _ I should have left _ but that's ok _ I'll come"
,"When?"
,"Just a few more words with this gentleman _ don't wait for me _ I'll be there within minutes"
,"Ok then"
,"The room is locked"
,"The door's already unlocked"
,"Ok, the door is unlocked now"
,"I'm not sure to want details _ I admit that I was really scared the last time"
,"YOU scared?"
,"This thing plays with us _ it's scary _ even if, of course, fun too"
,"What are you doing up there?"
,"I'm looking for a lost manuscript _ if we're here to distract this 'god' _ considering we've all been up against him before _ with our best stories and characters _ we could spice things up with some unused plot"
,"Why is there an unused manuscript of yours here?"
,"I've written it here the last time, before meeting the Master _ a derivation from a story I've written and lost even in our time in 1972 _ that I rewrote later on, but in a different way"
,"I've lost YOU"
,"Here it is! _ 'The Dome Cannibals'! _ It's a story of people trapped in a closed place _ there are minor resemblance points with what we're living now _ but it's a strong narration that I think can fit our host tastes"
,"Can you take it and see if it can help?"
,"I'll keep on looking _ I may have written other two or three novels the last time while waiting"
,"Nope _ I can't think about a way out _ but I may have a bias, like the other fellow writers _ we're scared, but we love this place too"
,"Any idea about what's happening?"
,"My two cents? It's an alien life form _ alien not in the out-of-eath meaning, but just completely different from us _ they took it out of his domain and it's just trying to understand _ it feeds with emotions _ us writers, thanks to our readers, may seem to it like this world governors _ it wants to interact with us to understand how to move"
,"Does it want to become a writer too?"
,"It wants to create strong emotions to eat _ and fear is a valid one"
,"I'll leave you to your research"
,"A half empty library"
,"Naah... I don't like reading so much"
,"Pardon?"
,"Oh, I mean, sorry I'm not a waiter _ you can take what you want from the table"
,"Sorry, I don't understand"
,"Oh, yes, there's nothing unforgettable, but it's all good _ and there are also non-alcoholic drinks _ I mean _ orange juice _ but it's good"
,"Yes, but one of them said they won't come"
,"well we'll wait a few minutes more then..."
,"Ah, here they are"
,"Please, get near"
,"Do you want to make some forewords?"
,"They don't need to know"
,"Sorry, what?"
,"You've already been here before _ you knew what this place is"
,"Actually..."
,"Don't play this card _ you may not know how it works _ but you KNOW that there's something powerful here _ and powerful ALWAYS means dangerous _ but you all came, when we send you a second invitation"
,"Last time seemed different"
,"Your whatever time ago, was less then a week here _ but that's not important _ the Master called us and then you to FEED his prisoner _ yes, a mutual feed, we are not here to complain _ but NOW there's no Master anymore _ he cannot control the thing he captured"
,"We're all grown up here _ can you call the 'thing' with a name? _ what's behind this mind's playground?"
,"A God _ a sleeping, dreaming God _ probably almost unaware of what's happening"
,"It's a PLANT _ something Master took out of the depth of the ocean"
,"It's a GOD _ it can walk through TIME! _ it can summon people from different periods _ it can give them a way to see and talk with fragments of their imagination!"
,"It's going to rip everything apart _ we agree with that"
,"We called you here _ not one by one, but five at once _ because when he feeds he seems to lose his control _ so while the usual 'carnival' starts, we may able to reach the Master _ and convince him to get rid of this damn thing _ if he still can"
,"So we're here as a distraction?"
,"Or are we a bait?"
,"Maybe it's not the best moment to say that _ but uhm I may have crashed this place"
,"Not so hard to believe _ but not the best moment, no"
,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH"
,"What's happened?"
,"The bloodbath has started!"
,"Play with your monsters and heroes _ create your stories and show them to it _"
,"Where's Jules?"
,"He didn't want to come"
,"I want to leave _ and I want to stay here too _ this place is dope _ let me know how can I help"
,"We still need moments to think _ you, whoever you are _ try to stay alive"
,"Nothing _ just here to say that I'm still alive"
,"What now?"
,"We stick to our plan _ hoping that dealing with the imagination of so many of us can weaken the plant _ we wait and see"
,"I've only met him once, but I'm sorry Dan Brownx isn't here _ he seemed like a guy who could understand complex things _ that's probably why he didn't come"
,"Ehm..."
,"He's not here because of me _ I've 'taken' his invitation and preceeded him here"
,"So he may be on Twinsmouth West? _ we can somehow hear people from other periods when they're near the bridge _ if they've got items from this place"
,"I'm sure to have understood your words _ You mean that we can talk with them?"
,"No, no, if we're near the bridge, and they're too _ we may hear them in specific situations _ but they cannot hear us back"
,"How's that useful?"
,"Never said it was"
,"Up there I've done a simple test _ and my opinion is that that thing perceives human beings _ not simple movement, but our essence _ so there's no way to reach the gate"
,"Good! I love hearing about victories!"
,"We need to find a way to attack _ to hit this thing hard _ and stun it before it realises and counter-reacts"
,"Sorry, I'm in a conversation now _ we'll talk later"
,"Hey! Leave it"
,"Uh... a LOT of people slept here just in the last ten days"
,"Even Roddenberry was here _ and that surely explains the TrekCon _ and the red-shirt guys' presence"
,"He was in Venice room _ same floor as Ophelia room"
,"Let's see if I can find its key"
,"Did anyone tell you you're similar to H.P. Lovencrantz?"
,"Hilarious _ I cannot imagine why your name has been included in Master's list"
,"What's your name by the way?"
,"Nope _ if you want to play mysterious, it's fine for me _ just let me know if you want to go to your room before the talk"
,"About that room of mine..."
,"My room is Uphelia"
,"OPHELIA, you mean"
,"That's it"
,"Mmm... I didn't remember if it's been cleaned _ but ok _ this is your key, second floor, last room on the left"
,"My room?"
,"Yes, tell me your room name _ it was in the invitation letter _ and I'll give you the key"
,"I'll think about that"
,"It's a box with some random items inside _ mainly paper"
,"There are a lot of items _ probably things that need to be put somewhere else _ or broken objects _ even pieces of paper _ including opened letters"
,"Uh... there's a city map!"
,"but nothing that seems interesting"
,"Mmm... a shredded piece of paper seems an invitation... _ 'Dear Frank Baum...' who's that? _ '...your room will be 'Ophelia' ' _ mmm... nice to know that!"
,"It's a calendar but uh _ from 1809! _ it says that today is the 26 May"
,"I don't want to take it"
,"Wow _ nice _ let's wear them _ let's see if that way fishmen will hate me less"
,"I am already wearing them"
,"They're sneakers _ but they look like they're made of crystal!"
,"It's a screenplay _ it's signed by Roddenberry"
,"Hello, are you a writer?"
,"This is new _ I had heard of people asking for a doctor or for a fireman, but never for a writer _ what do you need?"
,"Oh, the usual stuff _ secrets of ideas for writing _ but who are you exactly?"
,"I'm Jules Verne _ and you are?"
,"I'm Marco _ maybe you've heard about me _ I create indie games"
,"Ah _ I've met another indian guy here before _ the other one seemed more as I expected him _ I'm really curious about your culture"
,"So you are Jules Verne"
,"Yes, that's me _ from France"
,"I don't care _ but good I guess"
,"I don't care _ I sense a story right here _ something great _ so I don't care about any monster 'over there'"
,"Yes, thanks _ Edgar's plan, I know about it _ my intention was to simply leave when the gate was opened again _ but I guess I've lost that chance _ anyway _ I won't come _ tell him that"
,"I'll try to take advantage of this place till I can _ and now I want to understand how this boat works"
,"What do you need to know about the boat?"
,"Do you know how does it work?"
,"They're easy _ there's an engine and a thing to turn left or right _ you just need a key to turn them on"
,"And what kind of symbol is this?"
,"Uh... never seen one like this _ but I suppose it's the brand logo"
,"And... maybe your eyes are better than mine _ but, over there, along the coast..."
,"...do you see a kind of light over there?"
,"Mmm... not so sure _ it seems just a reflex of something"
,"I don't think it's that, but who knows"
,"Uh... thanks! _ that's exactly what I needed"
,"I wasn't wrong _ there's a cave just over there _ with the same metallic sign I see here on the boat"
,"I need to go there!"
,"Let's see what's there"
,"Great! Let's go!"
,"I'm not sure that leaving this place with this boat _ without a goal _ will help me to go back home"
,"To use it, I need the key"
,"It's a kind of electric motorboat _ it looks old and futuristic at the same time"
,"Mmm... the place to put the key is strange"
,"I'm not sure that leaving this place with this boat _ will help me to go back home"
,"And who might you be?"
,"And you two, why are you still here? _ you should have left and left me alone! _ now it might be hard to go away"
,"Damn _ that plant grows on him too"
,"What do you want? _ Leave my room NOW!"
,"This is your grandniece's diary _ it also contains notes written by your brother"
,"My grandniece? _ I don't even have a niece _ my brother has no child"
,"and here is my only son"
,"dead _ and in hell"
,"Read it"
,"My son has a child! _ I have a descendence!"
,"But _ how can this diary be written by the daughter of my son's daughter?"
,"She hasn't been born yet _ and she may not be able to be born _ if you don't stop this thing _ you'll have to take it back to where you found it before it's too late!"
,"NOT BEFORE SHE FREES MY WIFE AND MY SON!"
,"About that _ read your brother's notes"
,"Did he find my wife's body? _ on Bermuda Island?"
,"Did their ships get hit by a storm _ before they reached their destination? _ How is that possible?"
,"What are these two then?"
,"Those are your dreams _ regurgitated by the god you stole from the ocean"
,"I can't believe you _ nor this diary"
,"But you know it's true"
,"You know it's true"
,"If so, please help me"
,"Good _ it's finally sealed inside _ but its echoes are still strong _ and I'm doomed _ I could take this thing away from here _ but it's too late to take it away from me _ go _ I'll do what I need to do _ I'll ask Dhan a last mortal favor _ to take me back, with it, where they found it"
,"But first we need to let you return to your places"
,"you, young man, collect your period writers and use the bridge with them once it opens"
,"you, Edgard and Howard, help me with the others _"
,"let's hope that the power of this thing will let us send them back even trapped in this jar _ then you'll go, Howard _ and then, last, Edgar _ but... you've been here for too long _ and like me eat of this plant _ so I don't know..."
,"but I know _ so let's go..."
,"So..."
,"Are you still here? _ GO"
,"Ok, ok... _ I'm the one who solved all these troubles and nobody appreciates me the same..."
,"Do you want a medal? _ You should even not be here from the start"
,"So the trap is now ready?"
,"Let's see if it likes that"
,"I recognize it _ it's the jar we used to trap this thing to bring it here _ they said they were able to lure it inside with something special _ but I don't know what it was _ nor I cared, at that time"
,"He's covered by the plant _ it's hard to tell if he's alive or not _ just a puppet controlled by the plant"
,"Leave my son alone!"
,"It seems to annoy him a little"
,"It's NOT your son, you fool _ don't you see it?"
,"She's covered by the plant _ it's hard to tell if she's alive or not _ just a puppet controlled by the plant"
,"Leave my wife alone!"
,"It's NOT your wife, you fool _ don't you see it?"
,"It seems to annoy her a little"
,"This thing seems alive!"
,"Don't touch it!"
,"Like I said, we need to convince him to get rid of this monster"
,"He will not give up the ghosts of his son and wife without a reason _ we must give him one"
,"Why?"
,"Why what? _ Why have got this thing inside of me? _ because I'm desperate _ I'd sell my soul to the devil to repair my errors _ and instead I've lost it to THAT"
,"But I don't want you here _ none of you _ GO AWAY, NOW!"
,"Ehm"
,"GO AWAY!"
,"Wow _ that's scary!"
,"I need a way to cut its ties now that they're out _ and to close it inside the jar"
,"I've already got what I need"
,"The plant seems to ignore it _ I need a way to convince it to enter"
,"Yes! It works"
,"now the plant core is in the jar _ let's close it"
,"The saw cannot create a permanent cut _ each part the saw detach is back in a second _ I need a way to do more damage than that"
,"There's no more to cut"
,"It's impossible to cut its core, while it's tied like that"
,"I'm not sure I want to touch it"
,"The awl is useless _ I can create just little holes _ and they're soon filled again"
,"The curry oil clearly annoys it _ but I cannot cut it with that"
,"We need to find a way to remove this plant from this place _ to be able to send it back where it belongs"
,"This plant was taken here from the ocean _ if there was a way to bring it here there must be a similar way to bring it back"
,"How can you get rid of this thing?"
,"It's merged with the house"
,"It's merged with a lot more than that _ it's inside the core of the whole city now"
,"So it's impossible to move?"
,"The creature is not the plant"
,"What do you mean?"
,"Do you see the yellow piece?"
,"THAT is the thing that destroyed my life _ the 'plant' is something that it emits and grows from it _ the plant protects it"
,"So we have to move just this 'seed'"
,"Not so easy anyway _ but please try"
,"The plant blocks the passage"
,"Luigi! Let us in! We need to talk"
,"What are you doing here? Go away _ I don't want to see you or anyone else"
,"You can't go on this way!"
,"Of course _ there's another plant here too to block us"
,"No reactions"
,"Yes! it seems to retreat"
,"It doesn't work _ I can do just small holes _ and they're filled back within seconds"
,"STOP THAT! I'LL SHOOT YOU IF YOU KEEP DOING THAT!"
,"Is he armed?"
,"Who doesn't have a gun in their house?"
,"It moves a little _ but it doesn't retreat"
,"We need a way to bypass that plant _ it's probably meant to let in only the Master _ it has no eyes so I suppose it can recognize him in some other way"
,"Do we need another puppet?"
,"This situation is exactly the opposite _ we have to find a way to make it think we're like him"
,"Here's what I found"
,"A skeleton hand?"
,"There's a message with it _ it says it's Guido's hand _ Luigi's brother"
,"This could cheat the plant _ or not _ but it's worth a try"
,"We need a way to bypass the plant _ I don't know how _ maybe using the force"
,"Is it not dangerous to attack this thing?"
,"What do you think?"
,"Which way do you suggest to force it?"
,"Maybe there's a way to cut these tentacles enough to let us in"
,"There's a note with it _ it says it's Guido's hand _ Luigi's brother _ but the more strange thing is that in the message you're mentioned"
,"Am I?"
,"It says that an 'Howard' asked someone to have it"
,"This means hope"
,"How's that?"
,"If you don't get it _ I won't waste my time explaining it"
,"They are lead containers _ empty"
,"I've already taken one"
,"It seems a piece of the world map"
,"Yes but _ what's that land in the middle of Atlantic Ocean?"
,"It's a screen but it's not a touch-screen _ or it doesn't work with MY fingers"
,"There's a figure of a strange thing that seems a shellfish _ but with dark big eye"
,"There are other unknown symbols"
,"Nope _ I don't understand them _ and they MIGHT be commands to move the submarine _ I really don't want to start a voyage to the unknown this way"
,"I need to leave this submarine first"
,"Hey, don't touch it! _ it's part of this exhibition!"
,"I'm here to trade!"
,"Which kind of trade?"
,"I want the spyglass _ so give this screenplay a look"
,"Oh... _ I can't believe..."
,"Are you going to give me the spyglass _ and put that on display?"
,"Take the spyglass _ I'll destroy this document _ and if I discover that you mention it EVER again _ I'll find you and I'll burn your house with you inside"
,"Ok _ just to let you know _ I live in a rented flat so"
,"I've never seen you before in my live"
,"Is it an authentic film prop?"
,"Well, no... it's just a real spyglass we found it nearby _ but we have so few items on display that we cannot let you take away one _ of course we could TRADE"
,"Trade?"
,"If you have something worthy, related to the only Sci-Fi franchise that matters _ OR anything related to any of the creators, or actors _ we'll gladly trade it"
,"It's a spyglass _ first time I see one in real life"
,"Don't you dare to touch it"
,"It's a model of a sailing ship, called USS Enterprise _ nice"
,"It's a screenplay attributed to Gene Roddenberry _ but it's not about space travels _ it's about a voyage similar to Magellan's one _ with a crew similar to the Original Series _ fascinating"
,"Yes, yes _ I know _ I'll be there in time _ but before I need to teach these fools about serious Sci-Fi _ before they all die!"
,"But... what?"
,"Don't worry _ tell Edgar I won't be the last one"
,"Ok, thanks"
,"Shouldn't you be writing something?"
,"Shouldn't you be minding your damn business?"
,"Or not"
,"What's this MONSTER! _ it killed the Black Captain!"
,"SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"
,"Nope, don't want to go further"
,"That's way too stupid even for me"
,"Tickling it doesn't seem like a good idea to me"
,"It seems dangerous _ I don't want to interact with it"
,"It seems dangerous _ I don't want to interact with it this way"
,"I'm too distant from what I think is its head _ from here waving leaves doesn't do anything"
,"A curry oil-molotov? _ It doesn't seem the brightest of the ideas"
,"It's a scary giant octopus-like animal!"
,"Go to the gate!"
,"Yes! The monster seems to have retreated his tentacles from the gates _ maybe it won't react anymore"
,"Mmm... yes the monster doesn't even notice the puppet _ but how this can help us?"
,"Before entering it's better if I ask Poe and Lovecraft to come with me _ they surely know better what to do with the Master"
,"The monster now seems still"
,"It's still _ I don't want to wake it"
,"You've been a really good boy"
,"The only part of the Captain that doesn't seem burned seem his hat's white feather"
,"Let's take it"
,"I cannot help him in any way now"
,"It's the mutilated body of the Black Capitan _ his sword didn't serve him enough"
,"Fascinating _ it's like one of my dreams _ I cannot understand whether it's learning from me _ or whether being here I'm forecasting what's going to happen"
,"I don't find it so appealing"
,"Sure you don't"
,"Neither the black-dressed man does!"
,"Have you finished? _ let me do some test"
,"I think our plans are over _ there's no way to enter the mansion with that monster here"
,"Let's go back"
